This project was developed for my CS210 class, emphasizing the use of C++.
It's designed for file reading, string lookup, and string frequency counting.
The project prompt was to create a sales tracker for a grocery store. 
I think I did particularly well on exception handling in this code, and since that's something I'm not very skilled at, I'm quite proud of my work here. 
I could have consolidated my file reading and writing into its own class to improve the program. 
Integrating all the components learned in this course into one program is a skill on its own. 
With so many sections interacting, it can be difficult to keep track of what's doing what; I believe this is a skill on its own. By using many in-line comments, it's quite obvious what each code segment accomplishes.
The program is also very modular with clear breaks between modules, which assists with readability and maintainability.
